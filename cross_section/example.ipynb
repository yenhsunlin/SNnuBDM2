    "There are three functions that are directly related to your calculation: `diff_sig_xnu`, `sig_xe` and `eps_prime`. Others are for auxillary purpose and not needed for you. But if you are interested, I have written detailed docstrings for every functions. It should be not hard to operate them. Note that please consider that all functions are *vectorization un-supported* by default. If you want to parallelize the computation, please use python `multiprocessing` module.\n",

    "Here are the brief description for the three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `diff_sig_xnu(Tx,mx,mV,psi,gV,gD,Ef_max=1000)`: The differential SN$\\nu$-DM cross section for DM is deflected by angle $\\psi$ after scattering, in cm<sup>2</sup>.\n",
    "  - `Tx`: the kinetic energy $T_\\chi$ gained by DM after scattering, in MeV\n",
    "  - `mx`: the DM mass $m_\\chi$, in MeV\n",
    "  - `mV`: the mediator mass $m_V$, in MeV. Considering this is a free parameter and, it is usually proportional to $m_\\chi$, eg. $m_V = m_\\chi/3$\n",
    "  - `psi`: the deflection angle $\\psi$ for DM after scattering\n",
    "  - `gV`: the coupling strength $g_V$, dimensionless. It describes the interacting strength between DM-SN$\\nu$. In your calculation, set it as **1**.\n",
    "  - `gD`: the coupling strength $g_D$. It describes the interacting strength between DM-DM. In your calculation, set it as **1**.\n",
    "  - `Ef_max`: Default is 1000. Increase it if `root_scalar` error occured\n",
    "- `sig_xe(Tx,mx,mV,eps,gD)`: The total BDM-$e$ cross section, in cm<sup>2</sup>.\n",
    "  - `Tx`: the kinetic energy $T_\\chi$ gained by DM after scattering, in MeV\n",
    "  - `mx`: the DM mass $m_\\chi$, in MeV\n",
    "  - `mV`: the mediator mass $m_V$, in MeV. Considering this is a free parameter and, it is usually proportional to $m_\\chi$, eg. $m_V = m_\\chi/3$\n",
    "  - `eps`: the coupling strength $\\varepsilon$. It describes the interacting strength between DM-electron. In your calculation, you will be asked to set it as **1** or varying it according to `eps_prime`.\n",
    "  - `gD`: the coupling strength $g_D$. It describes the interacting strength between DM-DM. In your calculation, set it as **1**.\n",
    "- `eps_prime(gV,q)`: the induced kinetic mixing parameter $\\varepsilon^\\prime$ by $\\mu/\\tau$-loops, dimensionless\n",
    "  - `gV`: the coupling strength $g_V$, dimensionless. It describes the interacting strength between DM-SN$\\nu$. In your calculation, set it as **1**.\n",
    "  - `q`: the momentum-transfer $q$, in MeV. Usually this term equals $T_\\chi$ unless specified otherwise.\n"
